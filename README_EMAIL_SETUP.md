# Email Setup Instructions - COMPLETED âœ…

This portfolio includes a fully functional contact form with EmailJS integration that is already configured and ready to use.

## Current Configuration

The contact form is already set up with the following EmailJS configuration:

- **Service ID**: `service_zcs78oe`
- **Template ID**: `template_99niu0d`
- **Public API Key**: `ei0M6UgMq2pVvKGNg`

## Features Included âœ…

âœ… **Form Validation** - Client-side validation with comprehensive error messages
âœ… **Loading States** - Shows sending status with spinner animation
âœ… **Success/Error Messages** - User feedback for form submission with auto-dismiss
âœ… **Rate Limiting** - Prevents spam submissions (1-minute cooldown)
âœ… **Input Sanitization** - Cleans user input to prevent XSS attacks
âœ… **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on all devices
âœ… **Accessibility** - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
âœ… **Real-time Character Count** - Shows message length with visual feedback
âœ… **Enhanced UX** - Smooth animations and micro-interactions

## How It Works

1. **User fills out the form** with their name, email, subject, and message
2. **Client-side validation** ensures all fields are properly filled
3. **Rate limiting** prevents spam by enforcing a 1-minute cooldown between submissions
4. **Input sanitization** cleans the data before sending
5. **EmailJS API** sends the email directly to `sid240711@gmail.com`
6. **Success/Error feedback** is shown to the user
7. **Form resets** automatically after successful submission

## Email Template Variables

The following variables are sent to your EmailJS template:

- `{{from_name}}` - Sender's name
- `{{from_email}}` - Sender's email address
- `{{subject}}` - Message subject
- `{{message}}` - Message content
- `{{to_name}}` - Your name (Sidharth)
- `{{to_email}}` - Your email (sid240711@gmail.com)
- `{{reply_to}}` - Reply-to address (sender's email)

## EmailJS Template Setup

Make sure your EmailJS template (`template_99niu0d`) includes these fields:

**Subject Line**: `New Contact Form Message: {{subject}}`

**Email Body**:
```
Hello {{to_name}},

You have received a new message from your portfolio contact form:

From: {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
You can reply directly to this email to respond to {{from_name}}.

Sent from your portfolio website.
```

## Security Features

- **Input Sanitization**: Removes potentially harmful characters
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam with client-side cooldown
- **Email Validation**: Ensures valid email format
- **HTTPS Only**: All requests are made over secure connections

## Testing

The contact form is ready to test:

1. Fill out all required fields
2. Click "Send Message"
3. Check your email at `sid240711@gmail.com`
4. Verify the form shows success message
5. Test validation by submitting incomplete forms

## Troubleshooting

If emails aren't being received:

1. **Check EmailJS Dashboard**: Verify the service and template are active
2. **Check Spam Folder**: New emails might be filtered
3. **Verify Template ID**: Ensure `template_99niu0d` exists and is configured
4. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
5. **Test Template**: Use EmailJS dashboard to send a test email

## Rate Limiting

- Users can only send one message per minute
- Cooldown is tracked in localStorage
- Clear localStorage to reset cooldown during testing

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with fetch API support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design

The contact form is now fully functional and ready for production use! ðŸš€
